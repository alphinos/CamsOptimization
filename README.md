# *CamsOptimization*

## - [ ] **A dificulty one!** :purple_circle:
* It's a greedy optimization algorithm made in C for the second test of the "Linguagens de Programação I" subject.
* It was made in around 5 days (the test's duration was about 2 hours of the first day)
* The original problem is: you have a museum that is represented by a square matrix.
* Each row of the matrix represents a room and each column represents a connection between the row and the other room of the museum.
* Because of the starter proposition, the matrix must be symmetrical to represent the problem properly
* Basically, the algorithm picks the room with the most connections to other rooms and puts a camera on the room
* It's a problem in the same group of the traveling salesman problem and the backpack's problem
* It was really fun to do... I didn't know at the time, but I would join a research project with the professor of the subject
